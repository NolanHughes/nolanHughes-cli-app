-A CLI for top or all breweries in a city/near you(zip code, 25 miles around)/whatever BreweryDB API will allow. Include description of brewery, location, year established, link to website(if I can figure that out), hours(if they have them), and hopefully top-rated beers(possible just year round). Have additional prompt to see all beers once you are in the specific brewery object.
