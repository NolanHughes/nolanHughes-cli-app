# NolanHughesCliApp

## Installation

Clone repo from github (https://github.com/NolanHughes/nolanHughes-cli-app).

Run 'bundle install' to install dependencies.

Go to BreweryDb.com. Click on the developers tab and sign up for an account. After you sign up you can request an api key and use it with this app.

Create a file called '.env' in the root directory. In that file, create a global variable called API_KEY and set it equal to the api key you received from BreweryDb.com. Make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file so that your api key remains secret.

## Usage

Type the following and follow the on screen prompts.

$ bin/breweries-near-me

You can enter any city and find out a list of breweries from that city. You can select which brewery you want and find out more info on that brewery. From there you can also find out info on 3 of the brewery's beers. Have fun and learn about beer culture all over the world!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
